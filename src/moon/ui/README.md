# Solar System Treks Mosaic Pipeline (SSTMP) Moon UI

This directory contains files necessary to run the user interface for the SSTMP Moon UI. The Moon UI is a web
application that can be run on a Kubernetes cluster next to an Argo workflows setup which does the actual mosaic work.

For development purposes, you can run the UI on any computer that has `npm` installed. To do so, in this directory, run
`npm install` and then `npm run start-local`.
